我们现在的做法是扫瞄主控阶段，就连接上蓝牙，给主控发命令，获取设备名和密码，再断开蓝牙。

尝试一下新建一个代码分支或另外写一个测试程序，改成：
1. 蓝牙上电，蓝牙给主控发命令，获取设备名，并存储在内存。（谢鹏）
2. 蓝牙发AD包的时候，将设备名广播出去。（谢鹏）
3. iPhone扫描阶段不连接蓝牙，只把AD包中的设备名显示给用户。（聂勇）

我不知道这样改会不会对扫描成功率和连接成功率有帮助，请谢鹏和聂勇讨论并实验一下。

AD中一起发出的应该包括设备名，密码，hardwareID。如果只有设备名，那么无法进行自动登陆，保存密码等等操作。

AD包中只有128bit，16字节，在长度上可能有问题

== ble导致设备蓝牙模块奔溃的问题 ==
查看了Apple Mailing List 中关于Bluetooth的所有邮件（2012一年以来），发现其他人也遇到的该问题。详见下面该邮件：

[[http://lists.apple.com/archives/bluetooth-dev/2012/Aug/msg00130.html|BTLE reconnection problems]]


在邮件中使用“messing with the state of the BTLE stacA”描述该问题。别人的回复中提到，反复的scan，connect，disconnect并不是corebluetooth库建议方式。其中提到了下面这两个视频。有点困难就是该视频没有字幕。

For more info, please see the two WWDC2012 talks about Core Bluetooth.


一些测试和结论：
a）出现该问题的情况一般都发生在重连的过程中，确实和邮件中提到的一致；
b）按照我们现在的ble设计，扫瞄主控就必须连接它，获取用户名和密码，也就是回出现上面的scan－discover－connect设计问题；
c）谢鹏已经将设备名从AD中广播出来，我们也进行了简单的测试，如此将绕过上面的反复scan－discover－connect的过程；如果后续的开发顺利，ble通信计划在app第二次提交apple store时修改；同时，地面站也需要修改。

=== ASK by RAM ===
I repeatedly face connection problems where the only way to discover a BTLE device which is constantly advertising is to turn On/Off Bluetooth in the iPhone through settings or in rare cases restart the phone itself. My app runs in the background and is scanning for devices with a specific list of services and it works most of the time. With one of the BTLE devices were using we had some reliability issues so I have retry logic which will repeatedly attempt to connect to a recently discovered UUID for a short while before giving up, Iam not sure if this behavior is messing up the stack.

Is there a way to debug the discovery issue or any recommended steps to ensure we are not messing with the state of the BTLE stack [ like not doing repeated connection attempts etc ] ?

Hi Ram,
Let me see if I can help you.

- While in background mode, you will see get notified once if a new device comes within range.
- If you got that notification while the app was in the foreground you may not get any notification when the app enters the background.
- Connection request "pend" forever and will not timeout (they can be cancelled)
- No need to scan for the device every time
- You simply can connect to the device without scanning for it if you have previously connected to or paired with the device using it's UUID.

Thanks for the reply. Much appreciated. I understand the below pointers about the BT api. The logic I use is scan forever, once a device is discovered stop scanning and connect to the device. Once the device disconnects, scan again. The retries to repeatedly connect is an aberration in my question [ please ignore it ]. The above loop of scan,connect,scan seems to cause a problem of no device being discovered unless I restart BT through the Settings app. Of course this is not a consistent problem, I have had it work for days before this happened but sometimes it will show up in hours during my development .

I am wondering if this is a known bug or are there anything I need to take special care about to avoid messing up the BT stack. I would also like to point out that the BTLE device I am using does follow the Apple Bluetooth guidelines for advertisement intervals and connection parameters.

Hi Ram,

I suggest you only scan for the device the first time. After connecting to it the first time, simply just try to connect to it using it's UUID instead of scan-discover-connect.
