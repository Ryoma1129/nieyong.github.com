[_overlay removeFromSuperview];
[_transition removeFromSuperview];

_overlay等在removeFromSupperview之后就会被释放掉（release）。

    If the receiver’s superview is not nil, the superview releases the receiver. If you plan to reuse a view, be sure to retain it before calling this method and release it again later as appropriate.
