== Web SQL Database ==
The Web SQL Database spec gives developers a simple but powerful JavaScript database API to store persistent data in a *local SQLite database*.


`'INSERT INTO entries (date, calories, food) VALUES (?, ?, ?);'`, This is  the  statement  that  will  be  executed.  The  question  marks  are  data placeholders.

`[date, calories, food]`, This is an array of the values being sent to the database. They correspond by position with the data placeholder question marks in the SQL statement.
