</ol>

<p>
<strong>Tip</strong>
</p>

<p>
Please reffer to your TX manual for more setting details.
</p>


<h2 id="toc_0.4">4)Gain</h2>
<p>
<strong>What is the Gain</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Basic Gain is too large, you will find the aircraft oscillating in the corresponding direction. If too small, the operation and stability will not be so good or control could even be lost.

<li>
Attitude Gain determines the reaction speed of attitude from command stick, the larger the value the quicker the reaction. Increase it for sharper and quicker leveling action.

</ol>

<p>
<strong>Why Gain Adjustment is Necessary</strong>
</p>

<p>
Different aircraft have different gains, so that you can setup the Gain manually according to your aircraft to have a wonderful flying experience.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Tips</strong>
</p>

<ol>
<li>
The Pitch/Roll Gain of hexa-rotor are high than quad-rotor usually .

<li>
If the aircraft parts are not compatible, you cannot get good flight experience by adjusting the Gains.

</ol>

<h3 id="toc_0.4.1">A)Basic</h3>
<p>
<strong>Gains Adjustment</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Increase the Basic Gain 10% at a time until the aircraft hover or lightly oscillate after small command stick input.

<li>
Decrease the Basic Gain until the aircraft can just hover, then decrease 10% more.

<li>
Now the gain is perfect, but the attitude reaction change is slow. You can follow the steps to tune the attitude gains.

</ol>

<p>
<strong>Remote Tuning Setting</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Make sure the TX setting is correct.

<li>
Choose the X2/X3 channel.

<li>
The range of remote tuning is from half to twice of the setup value.

</ol>

<p>
<strong>Tips</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
The vertical gain will NOT affect the manual mode.

<li>
If the aircraft can lock the altitude when the throttle stick is at center position, the Vertical gain is good enough.

</ol>
<h3 id="toc_0.4.2">B)Advanced</h3>
<p>
Usually you can ignore this step. The default values are suitable for most of the conditions, so we do NOT recommend you to change the parameters here. To some special multi rotor, experienced player can adjust the advanced parameters to have a better fly experience.
</p>

<h2 id="toc_0.5">5)Motor</h2>
<p>
<strong>Instruction</strong>
</p>

<p>
You can cofigure the Motor Idle Speed and select the Cut Off Type. In order to obtain a better flight exprience.
</p>

<h3 id="toc_0.5.1">A)Motor idle Apeed</h3>
 
<p>
<strong>What is Motor Idle Speed</strong>
</p>

<p>
Motor Idle Speed is the lowest speed after motors start. It will affect motors lowest speed after the motors start. There are five levels from LOW speed to HIGH speed, and the default is RECOMMENDED.
</p>

<p>
<strong>How to set</strong>
</p>

<p>
Click the corresponding level to select Motor Idle Speed. RECOMMENDED is the advised level. Set it as LOW, the motor idle speed will be lowest.Set as HIGH, the motor idle speed will be highest. You can reset the it according to the real situation.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Important</strong>
</p>

<p>
For users whose aircraft takes off at lowest throttles position, please set the idle speed at a low level. For common users, set it to RECOMMENDED or above, since setting idle speed too low may affect motor(s) spool up.
</p>

<h3 id="toc_0.5.2">B)Cut Off Type</h3>
<p>
Push both sticks to the left bottom or right bottom to start the motors. Different Cut Off Type stops the motor in different way. Refer to the WKM Quick Start Guide for more details.
</p>

<p>
Immediately In any control mode, once motors start and throttle stick is over 10%, motors will stop immediately when throttle stick is back under 10% again.In this case, if you push the throttle stick over 10% within 5 seconds after motors stop, motors will re-start. If you don’t push throttle stick after motors start in 3 seconds, motors will stop automatically.
</p>

<p>
Intelligent In any control mode, only push both sticks to the left or right bottom can stop motors.In ATTI./GPS Mode, any one of following cases will stop motors. (1)You don’t push throttle stick after motors start within 3 seconds. (2)Throttle stick under 10%, and after landing 3 seconds. (3)The slope angle of multi-rotor is over 70°, and throttle stick under 10%.
</p>

<h2 id="toc_0.6">6)F/S</h2>
<p>
<strong>Instruction</strong>
</p>

<p>
Fail-Safe is one of the advanced function for the autopilot system. If this fuction is selected, Fail-Safe will be triggered when the Main Controller loses the control signal. The multi-rotor will automatically hover if the Fail-Safe mode is active, or Go-Home/Altitude Go-Home if in GPS mode using the GPS module. 
</p>

<p>
*Important: *
If you select the "Go-Home"/"Alt Go-Home" function, please make sure to connect to the GPS module correctly and record the home point successfully, since the autopilot system should know the home point when going home.
</p>

<p>
The home point of the ground station one key go-home is the same as the point set by user in the ground station software.
</p>

<h3 id="toc_0.6.1">A）Enhanced Fail-Saft Methods</h3>
     
<p>
Please select a Fail-Safe method in your desired.
</p>

<p>
*What is Enhanced Fail-Safe *
</p>

<p>
Using the GPS Module, you can select "Hover" or "Go-Home"/"Alt Go-home"(in GPS Mode). Otherwise, only Hovering. It will be triggered when the Main Controller(MC) loses the control.
</p>

<p>
*What is Home point *
</p>

<p>
Before takeoff, current position of multi-rotor will be saved as home point when you push the throttle stick first time after 6 or more GPS satellites are acquired for more than 8s. Assure correct recording.
</p>

<p>
*How to re-gain control *
</p>

<p>
Switch to Manual Mode or Atti. Mode to re-gain control of multi-rotor when it is in Fail-Safe Mode.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Important</strong>
</p>

<p>
The aircraft will not go home if the GPS signal is not good.
</p>

<h3 id="toc_0.6.2">B）Go-Home Switch</h3>
<p>
*What is Go-Home Switch *
</p>

<p>
Choose a 2-position switch on your transmitter as Go-Home switch. You should toggle the switch from the "Standby" to the "Start" to trigger Fail-Safe when flying. If already in a fail-safe condition, then the switch will not work.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Go-Home Switch Setting</strong>
</p>

<p>
Wire the right channel of receiver to X3 port of MC. You should assign both positions to "Standby" &amp; "Start", and then tick the CheckBox of Go-Home Switch. Move the slider of channel X3 to Start and Standby to turn the corresponding area blue respectively. Use the end-point fine tuning on your transmitter to set X3 channel to 30% ~ 100% if software does not give correct response.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Important</strong>
</p>

<p>
If the Go-Home Switch can not be chosen in the software, may be the X3 channel has been set for remote gain tuning, please cancel it.
</p>

<h2 id="toc_0.7">7)IOC</h2>
<p>
<strong>Intelligent direction control setup step</strong>
</p>

<p>
IOC is one advanced flight function, including Course Lock, Home Lock and POI(Point Of Interest). Here, Forward Direction is definited as that the multi-rotor will fly along this direction when you push the elevator stick. Usually, the forward direction of a flying multi-rotor is the same as the nose direction. By using IOC, wherever the nose points, the forward direction has nothing to do with nose direction.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
In Course Lock, the forward direction is the same as a recorded nose direction.

<li>
In Home Lock, the forward direction is the same as the direction from the home point to multi-rotor.

<li>
In POI, the roll channel controls the multi rotor circular flight speed around a fixed point, the pitch channel controls the diameter, the throttle controls the height.

</ol>
<h3 id="toc_0.7.1">A)Intelligent Orientation Control</h3>
<p>
<strong>IOC Setting Procedure</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Please choose a 3-positions switch on your transmitter as IOC switch, which is also used for recording the multi rotor orientation, home position or point of interest(POI).

<li>
Make sure to connect the correct channel of receiver to X2 port of MC.

<li>
Click the CheckBox to enable the IOC.

<li>
Select control mode options.

<li>
Togle the IOC switch to move the cursor of X2 to turn the corresponding area blue respectively.

</ol>

<p>
<strong>Tips</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
If you use S-Bus/PPM receiver, the default X2 channel connection is the 5th channel of the transmitter.

<li>
If the software does not give the correct response, use end-point fine tuning on your transmitter to adjust the X2 channel.

<li>
Refer to the Manual for operation info.

</ol>

<h2 id="toc_0.8">8)Gimbal</h2>
